# Knative Serving Conformance Workflow

These are the steps to be followed to test and gain knative conformance.

1. Run Manual Tests
- Manual tests can be automated if an investment is made
- For non Kubernetes implementation - See 
2. Open Github PR in knative/specs repo 
- Use PR template below
- conformance/tests/results/ directory
- conformance/test/results/$vendor directory with a metadata file and test results
- ex; .../v1.0/2021-12-18-ibm-code-engine/...
- Attach Logs from tests
3. KTC reviews 
- Template
- logs
4. KTC provide approval / exception / or non-approval
5. Post to conformance matrix - consumable by the general public as a table of version, product, vendor and outcomes.
- Should have a public “conformant implementations” showcase on https://knative.dev/offerings
